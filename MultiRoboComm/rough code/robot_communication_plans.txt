Everyone will connect to the mother node. Mother node will display global world map.

All children will communicate what objects they know the position of. This will enable a 'go fish' protocol: Mother node will sync robots that have the same landmark.
*ALL LANDMARKS ARE ASSUMED TO BE STATIC (barring the cozmos)

THOUGHTS:
*every client needs a unique ID
*need to connect clients with same landmark
*to sync on landmarks, either need landmark with position and pose or need two landmarks
*nice visual would be if every client had a unique map, but then those maps merge as clients talk start referencing the same landmark
*NEED to keep track of landmarks in constant coordinates (by offseting based on cozmo's position)
*need to offset connections & memory of landmarks if cozmo is picked up (aka reset)
*REACH GOAL: make it so robots can talk to one another. Would require each to have their own server setup and use of the mother node as a bus for communication?
